# School Management System API

This project is a School Management System API that provides features to manage academic activities, such as student attendance records, grades, and lesson plans. It is intended for developers, integrators, and other stakeholders who need to build custom applications that leverage its features. The API is not public and is only accessible internally, meaning that only authorized users from the school can use it. The API has three users: teachers, admin, and students. Teachers need to be authorized by the admin before they can use the application. The admin can also suspend or withdraw staff members from the application. Teachers can create exams for students and publish or withhold results, while students can write and check examination results and attempt examinations twice. The API also has an examination remark feature that provides feedback on examination performance. This project is still in progress, and the features may be updated over time. The next video will focus on the data flow inside the application to provide a clearer understanding of how it works.
