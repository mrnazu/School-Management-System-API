<h6>About Section</h6>
Inspiration: This project was inspired by our own experiences as students and the need for a comprehensive and efficient system to manage academic activities in schools. We wanted to create a solution that streamlines administrative tasks for educators and enhances the learning experience for students. This project is a Portfolio Project for ALX Africa Software engineering program, where we have been learning and honing our skills in software development.
